| gist | boolean | `false` |  |  | Whether to post the code in the text to Gist or not (only available if GitHub integration is enabled) |

## Tips

This plugin will overwrite the article with the ID set in `qiitaId`, or the article with the same title if it is found, or post it as a new article if it is not found.

Since ID matching is the highest priority, if `qiitaId` is set, it will overwrite the article.
